## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
The purpose of the E-Waste Facility Locator is to promote responsible e-waste management by making it convenient for people to recycle or dispose of their electronic devices in an environmentally friendly manner. By providing easy access to information about nearby facilities, the tool aims to encourage more people to participate in e-waste recycling efforts, thereby reducing the harmful impact of electronic waste on the environment.
## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The "E-Waste Facility Locator" proposes a digital solution to address the challenge of proper electronic waste (e-waste) disposal by providing a user-friendly platform for locating nearby facilities that accept e-waste. Here's the proposed solution:
1.Database of E-Waste Facilities: The solution involves compiling a comprehensive database of e-waste recycling centers, drop-off locations, and other facilities that accept electronic waste for recycling or proper disposal. This database would include details such as addresses, contact information, accepted items, operating hours, and any specific instructions for disposal.
2.User-Friendly Interface: The platform would feature a user-friendly interface, accessible via web or mobile application, where users can easily search for e-waste facilities based on their location or specific criteria. The interface would prioritize simplicity and ease of use to encourage widespread adoption.
3.Location-Based Search: Users would be able to input their location or allow the app to access their geolocation data to find nearby e-waste facilities. The solution would provide relevant search results based on proximity, ensuring convenience for users seeking to dispose of their e-waste responsibly.

## Use Cases
1.Individual Consumers:
    Individuals who have old or broken electronics can use the E-Waste Facility Locator to find the nearest drop-off locations or recycling centers.
    They can input their location or allow the app to access their geolocation data to quickly identify nearby facilities.
    Users can access details such as operating hours, accepted items, and any special instructions for disposal, making it easy to plan their visit.
2.Businesses:
    Businesses that need to dispose of large quantities of electronic equipment, such as outdated computers, printers, or office appliances, can utilize the E-Waste Facility Locator.
    They can use the platform to find e-waste recycling facilities that offer pickup services or accept bulk shipments.
    Detailed information about accepted items and disposal procedures helps businesses comply with environmental regulations and ensure responsible e-waste management.
3.Educational Institutions:
   Schools, colleges, and universities often accumulate e-waste from outdated technology and equipment.
   The E-Waste Facility Locator can assist educational institutions in finding nearby recycling centers where they can responsibly dispose of old computers, monitors, and other electronics.
   Access to educational resources on e-waste management can also support sustainability initiatives within educational institutions.
4.Community Organizations:
  Community organizations and environmental groups can promote the use of the E-Waste Facility Locator among local residents to encourage proper e-waste disposal practices.
  They can organize e-waste collection drives and use the platform to guide participants to designated drop-off locations.
5.Government Agencies:
  Government agencies responsible for environmental protection and waste management can integrate the E-Waste Facility Locator into their initiatives.
  They can partner with the platform to promote responsible e-waste disposal and provide citizens with access to reliable disposal options.

## Technology Stack
